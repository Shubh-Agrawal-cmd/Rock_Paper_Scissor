This is a simple program that implements a Rock-Paper_Scissor game through Python code using Python IDLE 3.4.3. Choose an input as instructed, and the computer will then select a random choice, decide on a result based on comparison, calculate points, and then ask the user if he wants to play again. If not, the user will see the final results.
